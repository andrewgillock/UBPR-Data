### UBPR Delivery Schedule (from https://www.ffiec.gov/ubpr/delivery%20schedule.htm)<a name = "update_instructions_delivery"></a> 
The UBPR for a given bank is usually published within a day of the underlying Call Report being filed at the Central Data Repository. If the Call Report for a given bank contains errors then the UBPR may not be published until those errors are corrected. Peer group average data is made available once most banks have filed their call reports and UBPR data has been computed. For all peer groups except 1 and 2 peer group averages are published 30 days after the date of a call report, or on the call report due date. For peer groups 1 and 2 peer group averages are published 35 days after the date of a call report or on the call report due date.

UBPR data is updated continuously. For the current quarter UBPR data is recalculated every night and published the next morning. UBPR data for the current quarter and four consecutive previous quarters is recalculated every Friday night and published the next day. Once a quarter a twenty one period recalculation is performed. That recalculation occurs two weeks before banks begin submitting a new call report and the data is published within 3 days.
